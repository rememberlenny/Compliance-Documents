### Authority

</div>

This publication has been developed by NIST in accordance with its statutory responsibilities under the Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA) of 2014, 44 U.S.C. ยง 3551 et seq., Public Law  (P.L.) 113-283. NIST is responsible for developing information security standards and guidelines, including minimum requirements for federal systems, but such standards and guidelines shall not apply to national security systems without the express approval of appropriate federal officials exercising policy authority over such systems. This guideline is consistent with the requirements of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130.

Nothing in this publication should be taken to contradict the standards and guidelines made mandatory and binding on federal agencies by the Secretary of Commerce under statutory authority. Nor should these guidelines be interpreted as altering or superseding the existing authorities of the Secretary of Commerce, Director of the OMB, or any other federal official. This publication may be used by nongovernmental organizations on a voluntary basis and is not subject to copyright in the United States. Attribution would, however, be appreciated by NIST.

### Reports on Computer Systems Technology

</div>

The Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) at the National Institute of
Standards and Technology (NIST) promotes the U.S. economy and public
welfare by providing technical leadership for the Nation's measurement
and standards infrastructure. ITL develops tests, test methods,
reference data, proof of concept implementations, and technical analyses
to advance the development and productive use of information technology.
ITL's responsibilities include the development of management,
administrative, technical, and physical standards and guidelines for the
cost-effective security and privacy of other than national
security-related information in federal information systems. The Special
Publication 800-series reports on ITL's research, guidelines, and
outreach efforts in information system security, and its collaborative
activities with industry, government, and academic organizations.

### Abstract

</div>

These guidelines provide technical requirements for federal agencies implementing digital identity services and are not intended to constrain the development or use of standards outside of this purpose. These guidelines focus on the authentication of subjects interacting with government systems over open networks, establishing that a given claimant is a subscriber who has been previously authenticated. The result of the authentication process may be used locally by the system performing the authentication or may be asserted elsewhere in a federated identity system. This document defines technical requirements for each of the three authenticator assurance levels. This publication supersedes corresponding sections of NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-63-2.

### Acknowledgements

</div>

The authors gratefully acknowledge Kaitlin Boeckl for her artistic graphics contributions to all volumes in the SP 800-63 suite and the contributions of our many reviewers, including Joni Brennan from the Digital ID & Authentication Council of Canada (DIACC), Kat Megas, Ellen Nadeau, and Ben Piccarreta from NIST, and Ryan Galluzzo and Danna Gabel O'Rourke from Deloitte & Touche LLP.

The authors would also like to acknowledge the thought leadership and innovation of the original authors: Donna F. Dodson, W. Timothy Polk, Sarbari Gupta, and Emad A. Nabbus. Without their tireless efforts, we would not have had the incredible baseline from which to evolve 800-63 to the document it is today. In addition, special thanks to the Federal Privacy Council's Digital Authentication Task Force for the contributions to the development of privacy requirements and considerations.

### Requirements Notation and Conventions

</div>

The terms "SHALL" and "SHALL NOT" indicate requirements to be followed strictly in order to conform to the publication and from which no deviation is permitted.

The terms "SHOULD" and "SHOULD NOT" indicate that among several possibilities one is recommended as particularly suitable, without mentioning or excluding others, or that a certain course of action is preferred but not necessarily required, or that (in the negative form) a certain possibility or course of action is discouraged but not prohibited.

The terms "MAY" and "NEED NOT" indicate a course of action permissible within the limits of the publication.

The terms "CAN" and "CANNOT" indicate a possibility or capability, whether material, physical or causal or, in the negative, the absence of that possibility or capability.
